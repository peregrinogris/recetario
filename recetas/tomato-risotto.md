### Ingredients
  * 60gr Butter
  * 30gr Olive Oil
  * 1/2 whole Large Yellow Onion, Diced
  * 3 cloves Garlic, Minced
  * 2 cups Arborio Rice, Uncooked
  * 8 whole Sun-dried Tomatoes Packed In Oil, Drained And Minced
  * 1 cup Dry White Wine (optional)
  * 7 cups Low Sodium Chicken Broth
  * Salt As Needed
  * Freshly Ground Black Pepper
  * 1 cup Parmesan, Freshly Grated (maybe less)
  * Fresh Basil, Chiffonade (optional)

### Preparation

Heat broth (note: it's important the broth be low sodium) in a saucepan or in a microwave safe pitcher. Set aside.

Heat butter and olive oil in a large pot or dutch oven over medium heat. Add onions and garlic and cook for 3 to 4 minutes.

Add dry rice. Stir to coat and cook for 3 minutes, stirring gently.

Pour in wine. Stir and cook over medium-low heat until most of the liquid is absorbed. Add in minced sundried tomatoes and stir.

Then begin adding broth, one cup at a time, stirring gently while the rice absorbs the liquid each time. Repeat this until the rice is done---it usually takes between 6 and 8 cups of broth. The rice should have a slight bite to it, but not be crunchy at all.

Remove from heat, then stir in Parmesan and heavy cream. Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Serve as a main dish with a salad, or as a side dish with steak, chicken, or fish. Delicious!
